## 💡 Philosophy  
> **To teach is to understand.**  
> **To learn is to question.**  
> **To think is to connect.**  

I believe clarity comes not from avoiding complexity but by walking through it.  
The greatest innovations happen where fields meet and blend — mathematics, AI, education, and philosophy.

✨ *Learn endlessly. Question gently. Create boldly.*
